## My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

During this WOD we created an itemized invoice based on data inputted into variables. As a result we used a mix of JavaScript and HTML to accomplish the goal.

## I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

I did not find this WOD particularly challenging as it required skills that we have been practicing for a while. Defining variables, computation, simple scripts. The hardest part for me was how tedious it is to replace digits without messing up. Most of the time when I make errors its something simple like a pissing semi-colon or incorrect spelling so taking the time to do it right the first time is crucial. 

## I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:

To prepare for this WOD I took a little bit of a different approach and did try to attempt recording the WOD until I was confident that I had the skills to accomplish the task. I spent a little time playing around and got the page to work as intended. Once I did that I deleted the project and started recording. 

## The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

Next time I will try to figure out what resources work best for me whether it be w3, htmldog, etc. Finding explanations that make sense helps a lot in understanding what the code is actually doing.

## I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:

## I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

## What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
