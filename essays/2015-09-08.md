Since I was little technology and computers always fascinated me. I built my own computer in middle school and was amazed that putting the separate components together yielded a functioning system. I was born in Chicago and raised in Thousand Oaks, California where I thrived in a good public school district and an area grown by biotechnology firms. 

I discovered the concept of cryptocurrencies the winter before high school and fell down the rabbit hole of decentralized technologies, payment systems, and governance. The concept of decentralization really stuck with me and to this day it is a principle I hold dearly. MIS appeals to me due to the nature of technology and business working together to create value and hopefully profits. 

I find my hands full with academics, extracurriculars, and contributing to a DeFi protocol but get a lot of personal fulfillment being involved in projects and initiatives that I find interesting and impactful.
