<p align="center"><b>Abstract</b></p>
Bitcoin (BTC) is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that operates as an independent currency uncontrolled by a government or institution. This study attempts to identify its strengths and weaknesses that concern the application and replacement of current payment methods such as Visa, Mastercard and American Express (AMEX). Collection of survey data and interviews with experts in the field of cryptocurrencies and business, bitcoin has shown promise in its application following its recent publicity in the media and the legitimization of cryptocurrency by government agencies. Through bitcoin’s extraordinary transaction rates and fees, it is clear that businesses which adopt the technology would not only save money on transaction fees, but allow the business owners the ability to access their funds much faster than traditional payment cards allow. The results of this study indicated that post-1982 generations are more likely to adopt bitcoin for transactions, it was concluded that with consumers aptability to adopt the technology and businesses flawed payment system, it would allow small businesses in the Ventura County to save hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.

<p>
Bitcoin is a financial tool with virtually limitless applications. One application that has been going unnoticed is its application and use for small businesses and their low volume of transactions. Bitcoin is an application developed by anonymous cryptographer Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, who developed the first decentralized ledger and bitcoin as the first use case for the decentralized ledger technology. Bitcoins, which can be broken up into one one millionth are stored in a “digital wallet,” which exists in the cloud, on a user’s computer or on a hardware wallet. The wallet is a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive bitcoins, pay for goods or save their money. Unlike bank accounts, however, bitcoin wallets are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and therefore, causes a feeling of distrust for the new technology, as there is no backup plan if your currency gets stolen or becomes obsolete. Though each bitcoin transaction is recorded in a public log, names of buyers and sellers are never revealed – only their wallet IDs. While that keeps bitcoin users’ transactions private, it also allows them to buy or sell anything without the purchase being traced back to them. Because of this, it has become the currency of choice for those online buying drugs or partaking in other illicit activities. However, the number of illicit transactions has decreased below three percent, according to The Dsepartment of Economics at Harvard (2017). The lower amount of use of bitcoin for illegal activities has begun to legitimize bitcoin as a legal currency as global economic powers such as China, the United States, and England begin to pass regulations and recognize bitcoin as legitimate currency. The transition of bitcoin into a legitimate market has piqued the interest of many researchers, and created a gap in research forits use by small businesses to implement the new groundbreaking technology that has changed the financial world.

Small businesses are defined as privately owned corporations that have fewer than one hundred employees and have an annual revenue less than a normal sized business. Many small businesses use traditional point of sale (POS) systems comprised of a payment terminal paired with a cash box. However, payment terminals are becoming outdated with transaction fees ranging from five percent up to seven percent. In small businesses, the average transaction is $13.35 according to the e-commerce bureau (2016). Because of the relatively low average transaction, the implementation of bitcoin within a small business has the potential to add an extra five thousand dollars on average into the local economy from each individual business monthly.

China, for instance, is a country that has seen rapid industrialization and implementation of smart technology as their culture has become much more apt to changes in practices such as transactions. According to iResearch Consulting Group (2018), a professional market research company based in Shanghai, China, the Chinese mobile pay market has skyrocketed to a staggering 5.5 trillion USD as opposed to the United States mere 112 billion USD. In China, you can pay for virtually everything using a cell-phone, from a taxi ride to breakfast, for the unbanked in China, digital currency has become their only currency.

<p>
As Allen E. Burger a researcher for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system stated in his paper entitled, “The Economics of Small Business Finance: The Roles of Private Equity and Debt Markets in the Financial Growth Cycle,” small businesses have an increased interest by policy makers, regulators, and academics in the nature and behavior of the financial markets (1998). Small businesses play a massive role in policy and infrastructure changes that occur throughout the business sector as they control a majority market share with small businesses dominating local policies decisions in small and medium sized cities. His explanation on the effect that small businesses have on the global economy as their ability to reshape not only the business sector, but the financial one has made them the primary source of advocates for the implementation of cryptocurrencies in the business world (Burger, 1998).

<p>
Burger’s key concepts on small businesses’ ability to reshape the industry has been seen as game-changing, with many contradicting him stating that the only way to reshape and industry is with a top-down solution starting with enterprises. According to the Small Business Administration (2015), America's small business economy is growing alongside the rest of the recession recovery. Although small businesses may be growing at a slower pace due to lending challenges, that disparity has not been enough to tip the scales. As small businesses continue to grow and remain the backbone of the United States economy. Small businesses as much as they may struggle on a smaller scale, employ more Americans than any other industry, making them a prime test subject to transition to the future of currencies, cryptocurrencies.

In an article produced by the The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (2013) entitled, “Bitcoin: A primer” written by François R. Velde, a senior economist, elaborated that bitcoin can truly rival or even replace existing currencies. The change from banknotes to an electronically based currency is inevitable as fiat currencies have been the means of transactions since the seventh century. As Velde states, bitcoin has the ability to reshape finance as we know it, and the move needs to come from an industry with the ability to make change in the corporations and enterprises above it.

Traditional currencies are backed by various governments whether it is the United States Federal Reserve or the People’s Bank of China. However, the problem of actual money systems that seem to realize the ideas of the commodity theory by connecting the value of money to gold or other precious metals is that they ultimately come up against the paradox that gold is priceless (Bjerg, 2014). A common argument against bitcoin technology is that there is no central body giving it value, nothing to stop its fluctuation or stability. However, our current banking system relies on constant trust in governmental bodies that claim to have certain amounts of financial stability to issue a statement of validity on their various fiat currencies.
</p>
<p>
Ole Bjerg, a professor at the Copenhagen Business School, states in an article titled, “How is Bitcoin Money?” published in 2016 expressed that if gold is the standard against which all other commodities are priced, how do we price gold itself. Perhaps the value of commodity money is not derived from the value of gold but the other way around. The reason why gold is so valuable is not that it incarnates a special form of value but rather because is endowed with the special function in its relationship to money. However, if gold is a commodity that is of such high value, bitcoin resembles similar functions to that of gold, with its degrecation properties mocking that of gold with less and less being introduced into the market year by year, it basically functions as an electronic version of gold. Once humans outgrow the idea of gold as the embodiment of special value that is beyond the symbolic order of money, we can see how bitcoin is perhaps a more honest form of gold money.

The transition for small businesses however may be difficult as some have been using the same practices for decades. As stated by Kalliopi N. Kypriotaki, in his article titled, “From Bitcoin to Decentralized Autonomous Corporations: Extending the Application Scope of Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Networks and Blockchains,” he depicted a scenario in which he put bitcoin in the position of a large-businesses only way to process transactions, and therefore, they had to convert and reap the benefits and drawbacks to the new technology. The benefits they sought however included a significantly lower transaction fee and the lack of a chargeback feature that could be exploited by consumers was seen as a significant benefit to the business. However, the business also saw a few drawbacks such as a longer period in which the transaction sits in a holding pattern waiting for the blockchain to send the funds from one digital wallet to another. Nevertheless, although the money may take ten to fifteen minutes to send, they transactions are verified instantly allowing for the merchant to be confident that they are receiving proper payment for the goods and labor they have distributed. (Kalliopi N. Kypriotaki, 2015)
