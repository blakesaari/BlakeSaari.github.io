<p align="center"><b>Abstract</b></p>
Bitcoin (BTC) is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that operates as an independent currency uncontrolled by a government or institution. This study attempts to identify its strengths and weaknesses that concern the application and replacement of current payment methods such as Visa, Mastercard and American Express (AMEX). Collection of survey data and interviews with experts in the field of cryptocurrencies and business, bitcoin has shown promise in its application following its recent publicity in the media and the legitimization of cryptocurrency by government agencies. Through bitcoin’s extraordinary transaction rates and fees, it is clear that businesses which adopt the technology would not only save money on transaction fees, but allow the business owners the ability to access their funds much faster than traditional payment cards allow. The results of this study indicated that post-1982 generations are more likely to adopt bitcoin for transactions, it was concluded that with consumers aptability to adopt the technology and businesses flawed payment system, it would allow small businesses in the Ventura County to save hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.

<p>
Bitcoin is a financial tool with virtually limitless applications. One application that has been going unnoticed is its application and use for small businesses and their low volume of transactions. Bitcoin is an application developed by anonymous cryptographer Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, who developed the first decentralized ledger and bitcoin as the first use case for the decentralized ledger technology. Bitcoins, which can be broken up into one one millionth are stored in a “digital wallet,” which exists in the cloud, on a user’s computer or on a hardware wallet. The wallet is a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive bitcoins, pay for goods or save their money. Unlike bank accounts, however, bitcoin wallets are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and therefore, causes a feeling of distrust for the new technology, as there is no backup plan if your currency gets stolen or becomes obsolete. Though each bitcoin transaction is recorded in a public log, names of buyers and sellers are never revealed – only their wallet IDs. While that keeps bitcoin users’ transactions private, it also allows them to buy or sell anything without the purchase being traced back to them. Because of this, it has become the currency of choice for those online buying drugs or partaking in other illicit activities. However, the number of illicit transactions has decreased below three percent, according to The Dsepartment of Economics at Harvard (2017). The lower amount of use of bitcoin for illegal activities has begun to legitimize bitcoin as a legal currency as global economic powers such as China, the United States, and England begin to pass regulations and recognize bitcoin as legitimate currency. The transition of bitcoin into a legitimate market has piqued the interest of many researchers, and created a gap in research forits use by small businesses to implement the new groundbreaking technology that has changed the financial world.

Small businesses are defined as privately owned corporations that have fewer than one hundred employees and have an annual revenue less than a normal sized business. Many small businesses use traditional point of sale (POS) systems comprised of a payment terminal paired with a cash box. However, payment terminals are becoming outdated with transaction fees ranging from five percent up to seven percent. In small businesses, the average transaction is $13.35 according to the e-commerce bureau (2016). Because of the relatively low average transaction, the implementation of bitcoin within a small business has the potential to add an extra five thousand dollars on average into the local economy from each individual business monthly.

China, for instance, is a country that has seen rapid industrialization and implementation of smart technology as their culture has become much more apt to changes in practices such as transactions. According to iResearch Consulting Group (2018), a professional market research company based in Shanghai, China, the Chinese mobile pay market has skyrocketed to a staggering 5.5 trillion USD as opposed to the United States mere 112 billion USD. In China, you can pay for virtually everything using a cell-phone, from a taxi ride to breakfast, for the unbanked in China, digital currency has become their only currency.
