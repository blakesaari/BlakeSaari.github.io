## How I completed the WODs

Due to the detailed instructions of the assignment, I did not find any of them particularly difficult. The required knowledge was only HTML and CSS which we have been learning in labs and readings. If there was something I was not familiar with too, a quick Google search often lends helpful information. The first WOD was quite simple with creating files and arranging simple tasks. The hardest task for me during the assignment was creating the navigation bar with spaced out text. Once I did a bit of searching, however, the solution was not difficult to find and integrate. 

## What I am doing next time

I think that looking over the WODs and determining what skills and tools will be necessary to complete the assignment crucial to meeting the time constraint. Once I am able to develop the skills to complete the assignment, a time constraint does not make it much more difficult.
