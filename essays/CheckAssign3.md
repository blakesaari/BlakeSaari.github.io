## Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear. 

A link to an overview of my design can be found [here](http://youtube.com)

## Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.

My sites shopping cart will be a seperate page that a user will be able to click on and adjust quantities or remove products all together. Once they add products to their cart, they will be given the option to view their cart, check-out, or return to the home page. The cart will have to store and maintain user's product data while a user is moving around product pages and assure that the data is in the format that the invoice is expecting. 

## Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.

Sessions will be utilized to manage my shopping cart as the method to store quantity data so that if a user logs-in they can return to their cart. The data stored within sessions will be through arrays in JSON.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example of data:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "

## How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?



## Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)



## If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?



## How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?
